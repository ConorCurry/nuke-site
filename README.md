# Nuclear Engineering Course Site

This is a project to modify the existing course site providing gamified quizzes to students.

## Objectives:

Increase "pedagogical value" of the game (it should be worth integrating as course material)
Reduce time & effort required by instructor for game management

## Roadmap

Improve account managment for students -- decreasing reliance on course instructor intervention
Improve game navigation -- implement simple timeline & quiz app. Sanely integrate game narrative
Provide easy data portal for instructors
